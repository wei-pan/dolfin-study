This test program solves Poisson's equation

    - div grad u = f

on the unit square and on the unit cube with homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary conditions.

In 2D, the right-hand side f is given by

    f(x, y) = 2 pi^2 sin(x) sin(y)

and the exact solution is u(x, y) = sin(x) sin(y).

In 3D, the right-hand side f is given by

    f(x, y) = 3 pi^2 sin(x) sin(y) sin(z)

and the exact solution is u(x, y) = sin(x) sin(y) sin(z).

The solution is computed with Lagrange finite elements of degree 1-5
and the error is computed in the maximum norm (maximum taken only over
the values at vertices).

Here are the results (2005-06-30, DOLFIN version 0.5.7+):
